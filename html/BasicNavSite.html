          Mathematical induction is a form of direct proof, usually done in two steps. When trying to prove a given statement for a set of natural numbers, the first step, known as the base case, is to prove the given statement for the first natural number. The second step, known as the inductive step, is to prove that, if the statement is assumed to be true for any one natural number, then it must be true for the next natural number as well. Having proved these two steps, the rule of inference establishes the statement to be true for all natural numbers. In common terminology, using the stated approach is referred to as using the Principle of mathematical induction.

          In mathematics, differential refers to infinitesimal differences or to the derivatives of functions.[1] This article links to differentials in various branches of mathematics such as calculus, differential geometry, algebraic geometry and algebraic topology.
